1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 exf4? { a mistake! this move is seen almost all the time at -1800 level. white can now get a huge initiative with e5! } 4. e5! { the only move that keeps the advantage! } 4... Qe7? { a very common try by black, but after Qe2 white still has no difficulties :) } 5. Qe2! { and now black's knight still has to go! } 5... Ng8 { for those who care: we are still on move 5 and white already has a whopping 72% winrate! } 6. Nf3 { d4 here is also a perfectly fine move, but Nf3 just avoids any annoying checks. } { [%csl Gh4][%cal Gf3h4] } 6... d6?? { a game losing blunder being played surprisingly in 61,000 games! Now white has to know how to punish black. } 7. Nd5! { the absolute game-ending move! the black queen is under attack and the e file is getting opened up } { [%csl Ge7][%cal Gd5e7] } 7... Qd8 (7...
