<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">This is a way to practice chess openings in a ‘drill’ format. When you make the right move, the next move is performed for you. If make a move that isn’t in the variation, no piece moves and a “Mistakes” counter increments. The individual variations of an opening are selected using a shuffle scheme. (I.E. random, but with history. A variation will not be selected a second time until all other variations from that opening have been attempted.)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">A user can customize their openings list by importing their own. Openings need to be in a specific format–directly importing PGN files is not currently supported. See “Importing New Openings” below for more information on that process.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Project Repertoire has a Firebase backend which is used to store the openings a user wants to practice, the shuffle history for the variations, and the Flagged Drills buckets–which is a subset of opening variations the user is currently focused on memorizing. We’re not storing anything else about the user. None of the google-analytics stuff is turned on. If you want signup with a fake email, that’s fine.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Other notes: Aesthetically, this web app is meant to run on a narrow screen–so if you’re using a pc, it’s suggested to resize to a width of 768px or less. For simplicity sake, we’re using the chessboard-js javascript chess UI library (not to be confused with the chessboardjs library). It’s simple to work with and so far, it does everything needed. Important: chessboard-js does not support drag and drop. For more information about chessboard-js, check out their github page: <a href="http://caustique.github.io/chessboard-js/#/">http://caustique.github.io/chessboard-js/#/</a></p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=11 data-line-end=12 ><a id="User_Account_11"></a>User Account:</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">After creating a user-account, you’ll have 12 openings by default. William Graif FM is the author of the original Lichess studies used to create these default openings. These openings are fun to play and that’s what inspired me to make this app.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15 ><a id="General_Usage_Openings_14"></a>General Usage: Openings</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">You should now see buttons corresponding to each opening stored for your account. The number beside each opening name is how many variations that opening has. If press one of these buttons, a chessboard will load and you’ll be prompted to make the first move as White or as Black. As mentioned above, when you make a correct move, the next move is performed for you. If you try a move that isn’t in the variation, a “Mistakes” counter will increment. If you’re stuck, use the Show Correct Move button. For more info about the openings, scroll down to see a button for any links that were in the pgn text.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=18 data-line-end=19 ><a id="General_Usage_Flagged_Drills_18"></a>General Usage: Flagged Drills</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">When you find a variation of an opening that you’d like to memorize, there is button to “Flag This Drill” or “Flag Last Drill”–depending on which page you’re on. This will add the active variation to a bucket of “Flagged Drills for White” or “Flagged Drills for Black”. This is so we can practice a smaller sub-set of variations from many different openings.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The “Flag This Drill”, “Flag Last Drill”, “Unflag This Drill”, and “Unflag Last Drill” buttons are context-sensitive. I.E. they should be hidden/visible at the right times.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">On the chessboard page, the “Practice a New Flagged Drill” button will randomly select a drill from the “Flagged Drills for White” or “Flagged Drills for Black” buckets without the user having to return to the main page.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">The application supports importing chess openings from a text file using a modified version of Portable Game Notation (PGN) format.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">IMPORTANT: Directly importing PGN files is not yet supported.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=31 data-line-end=32 ><a id="Preparation_31"></a>Preparation</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">Before you can import a new opening, you need to prepare a text file that contains the moves of the opening. <a href="https://github.com/johntennant/Repertoire/blob/master/wgraif_lichess_studies_converted/White/VonPopielGambit.txt">Here’s what the format of the file should look like.</a></p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">Each line break is parsed as a different variation of the opening. It’s important to have the name of the opening at the beginning of each variation. This is added automatically by the drag-and-drop PGN conversion script.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">As mentioned before, Project-Repertoire doesn’t yet support directly importing PGN files. To create your own openings for the app, you’ll want to download the  drag-and-drop batch file/python script. The process also uses a free, open-source commandline program called “pgn-extract” (<a href="https://github.com/MichaelB7/pgn-extract">https://github.com/MichaelB7/pgn-extract</a>).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">Important: A huge caveat here is the conversion process is imperfect. Some ‘massaging’ of the outputted result is usually needed. There are many unexpected things that can be found in a PGN file which makes it’s difficult to anticipate everything with a single script.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49">You can download all three files needed for making your own Project-Repertoire openings here: <a href="https://github.com/johntennant/Repertoire/blob/master/Repertoire_PGN_Convert.zip">https://github.com/johntennant/Repertoire/blob/master/Repertoire_PGN_Convert.zip</a></p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=50 data-line-end=51 ><a id="Conversion_Script_Usage_50"></a>Conversion Script Usage:</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">To use the batch file, you’ll need Python installed. Next, make sure the PGN filename is exactly what you want the opening to be called in your Repertoire database. The filename gets added to the beginning of each variation as the ‘opening name’. Next, drag your PGN file onto the batch file: “Drag PGN File Here.bat”. Two new files will be created, OpeningName_Complete.pgn and OpeningName.txt in the same directory. This new text file can be imported using the Import Opening button in the web app.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=54 data-line-end=55 ><a id="Importing_the_Opening_54"></a>Importing the Opening</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57">Once you have a local text file that’s been prepared as described above, press the Import Opening button. Using the file-select dialog, select your prepared OpeningName.txt file. The name of the text file becomes the name of the opening after it’s imported. Openings cannot be renamed.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="59">A dialog box will appear asking you to select whether you want to pratice the opening as White or as Black. After selecting the color, the opening is imported into the database associated with the current user and the color chosen. If you want to practice the opening as the other color, you must reimport the opening as that color.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">You should now see a new opening button with the same name as the text file you imported.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=62 data-line-end=63 ><a id="Conclusion_62"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="65">I primarily created Project Repertoire for my own personal use. (It’s amazing the lengths I’ll go to avoid actually practicing chess!) I have fulltime job that keeps me pretty busy and so I’m offering this up to the community without support. Please let me know if there are any bugs or (reasonable) feature requests, but please don’t take offense if I take a long time to respond. Peace!</p>
